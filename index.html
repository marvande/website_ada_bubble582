      <p>Introduction:</p>

      <p>In this project we are focusing on the consumerism habits related to the customers profiles from an unknown shopping center in the US. Living in a time and age where every piece of our data is stored and analysed, we wonder what information retailers can gather and infer about us. This shopping center recorded up to 2 years of transactions for a group of voluntary customers. Based on this data, we seek to identify what are the links, if they exist, between the specific demographics (e.g. marital status, income, number of children, etc) and the purchase patterns. In other words, we would like to see how "easy" and how precise it is for retailers to infer a specific profile to their customers based on what they buy. Which of course would lead to target their different clients with adapted marketing. In other words, we want to evaluate how much of a target we actually are.</p>
